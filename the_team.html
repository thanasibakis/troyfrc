				<h2>The Team</h2>
			</section>
			<section class="black-on-cyan">
				<h2>Intro</h2>
				<p>Troy High School's FRC team is out to prove the robotics is not just a competition for "smart" kids. Through the process of engineering a robot, members are exposed to new experiences, both academic and interpersonal. While learning how to design, build, and program a robot, members will hopefully also gain a sense of pride and accomplishment in their work.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="cyan-on-black">
				<h2>Who are We?</h2>
				<p>The Destroyers are from Fullerton, CA, and are the FRC team of Troy High School. As students from a technology magnet school, most members have experienced first-hand the power of technology whether at home or at school and are enthralled or intrigued by sciences and technologies. As a team, we aim to inspire people from our school and our communities by showing others how useful and exciting technology can be!</p>
			</section>
			<section class="black-on-cyan">
				<h2>Our Strategy</h2>
				<p>Because we recognize that all members have their own unique hobbies and skills, everyone is encouraged to pursue their own interests. Some choose to wire and build the robot, while others choose to conduct research. Still others volunteer to write programs, and some choose to become more involved in community outreach. As such, the presence of different divisions have taught us about the importance of communication between all group members; for instance, the programmers cannot fully test the robot until the completion of both the field and robot.</p>

				<h2>Our Mentors</h2>
				<p>Along the way, we've had the support of many people. Much thanks goes out to the Harvey Mudd College mentors who came to guide us despite the distance between Troy High and Harvey Mudd, and our mentor Richard Sisk. Also, nothing would have been possible without Michael Chapman and Kent Goodman, Troy Tech teachers who agreed to help and advise us.</p>
